<h2>1. Bard vs ChatGPT: What’s the difference? </h2>
<p>
The biggest difference between ChatGPT and Bard is the Large Language Models (LLMs) they are powered by. ChatGPT uses the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), while Bard uses the Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMBDA). Also, ChatGPT is developed by OpenAI, while Bard was built by Google.

In terms of capabilities, both do very similar things. Programmers can use ChatGPT for:
Suggestions: Both models can suggest the correct syntax and parameters for functions and other code constructs.

Completion: It can complete code that you have started writing.

Debugging: It can help you identify errors and problems in your code.

Explanation: It can explain the code that it generates, or code you input.

Both models were trained on a massive dataset, including Common Crawl, Wikipedia, books, articles, documents, and content scraped from the internet. However, Bard is a little different in that it was trained on conversations and dialogues from the web, while ChatGPT was trained mostly on scraped general content.

Both products are still under development, Bard a bit more so than ChatGPT. But to really show how these differences actually matter in a practical sense, here’s how they work when tested against each other.
